## Act like you make $1000/hr

The author argues that most people undervalue their time, which leads to procrastination, wasting time on low-value tasks, and not achieving their goals. He suggests that one way to overcome this is to imagine that your time is worth $1,000 per hour, even if it's not your actual hourly rate.

By adopting this mindset, you'll start to prioritize your time more effectively and focus on high-value tasks that will move you closer to your goals. You'll also be less likely to waste time on unimportant tasks or activities that don't align with your priorities.

The author provides several tips for implementing this mindset, including setting clear goals, identifying high-value tasks, delegating or outsourcing low-value tasks, and tracking your time to identify areas where you can be more efficient.

Overall, the article suggests that by valuing your time more highly and adopting a productivity-focused mindset, you can achieve more in less time and ultimately become more successful in your personal and professional life.

## How to think like a programmer

The article outlines several key principles for effective problem-solving as a programmer, including breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, testing your assumptions, and learning how to debug effectively.

The author emphasizes the importance of taking a methodical approach to problem-solving, starting by understanding the problem statement and breaking it down into smaller sub-problems that can be tackled individually. He suggests using a flowchart or pseudocode to map out the steps you'll need to take to solve the problem.

Another key principle is testing your assumptions as you work through the problem. This means checking your assumptions at each step and verifying that your code is working as expected. The author notes that this can often involve a process of trial and error, but that it's important to stay persistent and not give up too easily.

Finally, the author discusses the importance of learning how to debug effectively. This involves understanding how to isolate the source of a problem, using tools like print statements and debuggers to identify issues in your code, and systematically testing your code to identify and fix bugs.

Overall, the article provides a valuable set of principles for anyone looking to improve their problem-solving skills as a programmer. By breaking down complex problems into smaller parts, testing your assumptions, and learning how to debug effectively, you can become a more effective and efficient problem solver.

## Solving Problems

The article emphasizes the importance of breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts in order to solve them effectively. The author notes that this approach can be particularly useful for programming, where complex algorithms and systems can seem overwhelming at first.

One key principle is to start by defining the problem as clearly as possible. This means identifying the specific inputs, outputs, and constraints of the problem, and understanding what you're trying to achieve.

Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, the author suggests breaking it down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. This might involve identifying patterns in the problem or breaking it down into simpler components.

Another important principle is to use abstraction to simplify the problem. This means focusing on the high-level concepts and ignoring low-level details that aren't essential to the problem at hand.

The author also discusses the importance of testing and debugging as part of the problem-solving process. He suggests using test-driven development to verify that your code is working as expected and to catch errors early in the development process.

Overall, the article provides a valuable set of principles for effective problem-solving in programming and other domains. By breaking down complex problems into smaller parts, using abstraction to simplify the problem, and testing and debugging your code, you can become a more efficient and effective problem solver.

## The 5 Whys

The "5 Whys" is a problem-solving technique that involves asking a series of questions to identify the root cause of a problem. It is often used in IT to diagnose and resolve issues with software or hardware systems.

The technique involves starting with a problem statement and then asking "why" the problem occurred. This question is repeated five times, with each subsequent question building on the previous one. The goal is to get to the underlying cause of the problem, rather than simply treating the symptoms.

For example, if a system is experiencing frequent crashes, the first question might be "Why did the system crash?" The answer might be "Because it ran out of memory." The second question might be "Why did it run out of memory?" The answer might be "Because there were too many programs running at the same time." The third question might be "Why were there too many programs running at the same time?" The answer might be "Because the system is not optimized to handle the workload." And so on.

By asking these "why" questions, IT professionals can gain a deeper understanding of the root cause of a problem and develop more effective solutions. The technique is particularly useful because it encourages a focus on the underlying cause of the problem, rather than simply treating the symptoms.

Overall, the 5 Whys is a valuable problem-solving tool for IT professionals, allowing them to diagnose and resolve issues with software and hardware systems in a more efficient and effective manner.

## The Super Mario Effect

In this TEDx talk, Mark Rober introduces the "Super Mario Effect," a psychological phenomenon that can help us learn new skills and overcome obstacles.

The Super Mario Effect is based on the idea that we are more motivated to learn and persist in our efforts when we experience a sense of progress and achievement. Rober illustrates this concept by comparing the way we approach learning a new video game versus the way we approach learning a new skill in real life. When playing a video game like Super Mario, we are willing to fail and try again repeatedly until we succeed. But in real life, we are often discouraged by failure and give up too soon.

Rober suggests that we can apply the Super Mario Effect to real-life learning by setting clear goals, breaking down complex tasks into smaller parts, and celebrating small wins along the way. By doing so, we can experience a sense of progress and achievement that motivates us to keep going.

As an IT student, it's important to apply the Super Mario Effect to your learning process. By setting clear goals for yourself, breaking down complex topics into smaller parts, and celebrating your progress along the way, you can overcome obstacles and learn more effectively. Additionally, by seeking out challenges and embracing failure as an opportunity to learn, you can become a more resilient and successful IT professional.
